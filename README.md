#  Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project builds a machine learning system to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing techniques and classical ML algorithms.

---

##  Goal
To detect and classify fake news using the **WELFake Dataset**, and deploy a lightweight, interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time prediction.

---

##  Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - WELFake Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification)
- **Contents**:
  - `text` (news content)
  - `label`: `0 = Fake`, `1 = Real`
  - ~72,000 labeled news samples

---

##  Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing
   - Punctuation removal
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming (Porter Stemmer via NLTK)

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization (Top 1000 features for speed)

3. **Model Training**
   - Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
   - Linear SVM (best performing)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix visualization
   - Final comparison chart

5. **Deployment**
   - Live Streamlit UI added using saved `.pkl` model and vectorizer

##  Results

| Model                | Accuracy   |
|---------------------|------------|
| Naive Bayes          | 93.71%     |
| Logistic Regression  | 98.74%     |
| Linear SVM (Best)    | **99.31%** âœ… |
